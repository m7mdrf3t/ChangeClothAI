2. Follow the prompts to create a Netlify account
3. Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

### 2. Vercel (Free)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

**Steps:**
1. Run `vercel` in your project directory
2. Follow the prompts
3. Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

### 3. GitHub Pages (Free)

```bash
# Install gh-pages
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# "predeploy": "npm run build",
# "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

## Before Deploying

### 1. Get Your API Key
- Visit [changeclothesai.online](https://changeclothesai.online)
- Sign up and get your API key
- The app is now configured to use user-provided API keys

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
npm start
```
- Enter your API key
- Test with sample images
- Make sure everything works

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
- Creates optimized production build
- Ready for deployment

## Post-Deployment

### 1. Test Your Live App
- Visit your deployed URL
- Enter your API key
- Test the clothing transformation feature

### 2. Share Your App
- Share the URL with others
- No CORS issues in production!

### 3. Monitor Usage
- Check your API usage on changeclothesai.online
- Monitor app performance

## Environment Variables (Optional)

For better security, you can use environment variables:

### Netlify
1. Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key`
3. Update the app to use `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY`

### Vercel
1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key`

## Troubleshooting

### If CORS still occurs:
- Make sure you're using HTTPS
- Check that the API endpoint is correct
- Verify your API key is valid

### If deployment fails:
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Ensure the build completes successfully
- Check the deployment logs

## Cost Considerations

- **Netlify/Vercel**: Free tier includes 100GB bandwidth/month
- **API Usage**: Check changeclothesai.online pricing
- **Scaling**: Upgrade hosting plans as needed

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored in browser (not ideal for production)
- Consider implementing a backend proxy for better security
- Monitor API usage to prevent abuse

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Choose your hosting platform
2. **Test**: Verify everything works online
3. **Share**: Share your app with users
4. **Monitor**: Track usage and performance
5. **Improve**: Add features based on feedback

Your app will work perfectly once deployed online! ðŸš€
